## Data structures

### Are a collection of values or an arrangement of data. They are also used to organize our data

* Insertion
* Deletion
* Traversal - access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed
* Searching
* Sorting
* Access

### Algorithms are the steps or processes that allow us to write programs

### Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs
