# Linked Lists

![Alt text](./Doubly-Linked-Lists.png?raw=true "Title")

* Linked List is a data structure that consists of a group of vertices (nodes) which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each vertex is composed of a data and a reference (link) to the next vertex in the sequence.

* Linked List and its variations are used as underlying data structure to implement List, Stack, Queue, and Deque ADTs
* It is a simple linear data structure,
    It has a range of potential applications as a list ADT e.g. student list, event list, appointment list, etc (albeit there are other more advanced data structures that can do the same (and more) applications better) or as stack/queue/deque ADTs
* It has interesting corner/special cases to illustrate the need for a good implementation of a data structure
* It has various customization options and thus usually this Linked List data structure is taught using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) way.
* A list that is linked. Contains a set of nodes. Contains two elements. The value of the data you want to store. And a pointer to the next node in line. First Node is the head, the last node is the tail.
* They are null terminated which signifies it's at the end of the list
* An element that links to the next element... that links to the next element... until you hit the last element that points to null
* They can be sorted or unsorted
* Nodes can contain all forms of data types

## Singly Linked Lists and  Doubly Linked Lists

* **get(i)** — maybe a trivial operation, return ai (0-based indexing)
* **search(v)** — decide if item/data v exists (and report its position/index) or not exist (and usually report a non existing index -1) in the list
* **insert(i, v)** — insert item/data v specifically at position/index i in the list, potentially shifting the items from previous positions: [i..N-1] by one position to their right to make a space
* **remove(i)** — remove item that is specifically at position/index i in the list, potentially shifting the items from previous positions: [i+1..N-1] by one position to their left to close the gap
* The main difference between arrays and linked lists is that in an array an element or elements are indexed. if I wanted to go to an item at index 5 I can do that easily in an array. In a linked list, you start at the head and traverse the list until you get to the Item. You start from the head and you keep going until you hit Null
* We're going to have to use something like a WHILE loop when we implement our own linked lists because we don't usually know how long the list is going to be
* Iterating through a linked list or traversing through a linked list is usually quite a bit slower than iterating through items like an array **O(n)**
* Advantages of using a linked list over an array is you don't have to worry about index shifting.
* Advantages of using linked lists over hash tables is there is a sense of order where one pointer is pointing to the next node. So you can have sorted data unlike hash tables

* Doubly linked lists are similar to Singly Linked Lists except that it links to the node before it.

* Doubly linked lists allow us to traverse our list backwards because of the extra pointer from the second element pointing backward toward the head.

* Singly Linked Lists can only go from beginning to the end of a list. Doubly Linked Lists can traverse forward and backward in either direction.
* It's exactly the same as the Singly Linked List but contains this additional pointer to the previous node and searching through a Doubly Linked List can actually be a little bit more efficient.
* Look up can technically be O(n/2) because we can start at both ends and if we know which half of the list the item we're looking for is, we can pick the optimum place to start.
* A downside to a Doubly Linked Lists is that we might have to hold a little bit more memory and an additional block of memory

### Pros and Cons (Singly vs. Doubly)

#### Pros

* Fairly simple implementation especially compared to the Doubly
* Requires less memory
* Since it uses less operations, it is faster

#### Cons

* It cannot be iterated in reverse or traverse from back to front if we ever lose the reference to `this.headNode` of the list.The list can actually be lost in memory forever so singly list is appropriate to use when you have less memory or memory is really expensive. Primarily used for fast insertion and deletion and not so much searching.

* For doubly linked lists, the plus side is that it can be iterated or traversed both from the front or from the back. Also, if you need to delete a previous node you don't need to traverse from the head node and find what the previous notice which a singly list linked list has no concept of.You can do that fairly easily with a doubly linked list.
* The downside of using doubly linked lists is that it is fairly complex and requires more memory and storage because of the extra property. There are some actual operations that we need to perform to ensure that when we insert and delete, that the previous property is updated as well. So double linked lists are really good when you don't have that much limitation on memory and when you want good operation for searching for elements, such as searching backwards instead of just forwards.

* **prepend O(1)** -- add to beginning of linked list
* **append O(1)** -- add to end
* **lookup O(n)** -- traversal
* **insert O(n)**
* **delete O(n)**

---

### Pointers

* Is a reference to another place in memory or another object or another node

---
```javascript
const basket = ['apples', 'grapes', 'pears'];
// how do we create a basket that's not an array but instead a linked list

// linked list: apples(8947) --> grapes(8742) --> pears(372) --> null (--> signifies pointers)(Parentheses signifies memory space or location)

// Why could Linked Lists be better than arrays or hash tables
---

let obj1 = { a: true };
let obj2 = obj1 // we've created a pointer. A reference to an object. The object here is not being copied but instead referenced


console.log(obj1); // { a: true }
console.log(obj2); // { a: true }

obj1.a = 'boo';
delete obj1; // even though we tried to delete. since it's still being referenced somewhere it is still held in memory because there is still a pointer to a location in memory (garbage collection -memory is managed automatically) If nothing is being pointed to it it is deleted.
In low level programming languages, you have to manually manage referenced items in memory

console.log(obj1); // { a: boo }
console.log(obj2); // { a: boo }
```

### Linked List

#### 1-->10-->5–->16
```javascript
let myLinkedList = { // think of a node as a bucket of data. in this case our node is our object to put our data
  head: {
    value: 10, // value of the node
    next: {
      value: 5,
      next: {
        value: 16, // references tail
        next: null // end of list // null terminated
      }
    } // the pointer or reference to next node which in this case is another object
  }
}
1-->10-->5–->16
```

```javascript
